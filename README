Pocket Desktop is a customised Live Linux system based on Ubuntu. 64-bit only.

It's designed with online safety, security and privacy in mind. Derived from a previous work to which this developer made and inspired by Tails but meant to be a more everyday usable equivalant this project hopes to be a handy, portable Linux desktop you can carry in your pocket.

Yep, that's it.

It is recommended to also grab the linux-privacy repository, which should also be sitting in the parent folder, for the Tor and privacy scripts to work.

* Partition a USB stick into two FAT32 partitions 1) storage 2) system. "storage" could be 2-4G whereas "system" should be at least 4G.
* Insert USB stick. Double check "storage" and "system" partitions exist.
* Download ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso
* Place it in the parent directory outside of pocket-desktop
* Run #sudo ./make-base.sh
* Modify update_disk.sh to use your actual Linux account name eg: `whoami`
* Run #sudo ./update_disk.sh

This will now run on UEFI systems. To run on legacy boot options, run:
> grub-install --force --removable --boot-directory=(path to USB)/boot --efi-directory=(path to USB}/EFI/BOOT /dev/(usb device)
Making sure "system" partition is flagged "boot" in fdisk, cfdisk or gdisk.
